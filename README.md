# ECON900_ps1
Problem set 1 for Econ 900

There are three parts in this repository. The first parts contain the web scraping for www.boardgamegeek.com. The second part contains the parsed results from the HTML page. The third part contains the analysis results of the data set. 

## Web Scraping

A normal web scraping method is not enough, because the webpage contains the dynamic elements. Variables name, ratings, and voter number are included in the static element, but the price is in the dynamic element. selenium will be used.

Safari has its own webdriver, so I use safari webdriver instead of other web browsers. The total number of webpage of scraping is 1,062.
